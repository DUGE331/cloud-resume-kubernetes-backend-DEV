☁️ CloudResume – DevOps Edition

This is my enhanced version of the Cloud Resume Challenge, built with a modern cloud-native architecture and CI/CD pipeline.

This repository represents the development (Dev) environment, focused on containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, automation, and scalability testing.

🚀 Project Overview

This project evolves the traditional Cloud Resume Challenge into a production-style system using:

Serverless backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)

DynamoDB visitor counter

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Docker containerization

Kubernetes deployment (Minikube for local cluster)

Future production-ready networking with Ingress

🏗 Architecture (Dev Version)
Frontend → API → Visitor Service → DynamoDB

Scale down when idle

🔜 Failure Recovery

Kill pods manually

Observe Kubernetes self-healing

Report restart and rescheduling behavior

🔜 Monitoring & Reporting

Track:

Pod replication

Restart counts

Scaling events

Document behavior under stress

🔜 Production Deployment

📊 Why This Version?

This project demonstrates:

Understanding of cloud-native architecture

Container orchestration

CI/CD automation

Infrastructure scalability

Production-grade deployment patterns

It transforms a basic cloud resume into a DevOps-focused engineering project.

🎯 Goal

Move from:

“Serverless resume project”

To:

“Production-style distributed system with scaling, recovery, and automation.”
